# Manual
---------------------------
Enter your first binary number using the '1' and '0' buttons. Then choose to subtract, add, multiply, divide, square, or squareroot the binary number. Then enter a second binary number (if square or squareroot weren't selected). When the second binary number is entered, click the '=' button to show the result. If you want the decimal value, click the 'Toggle Binary/Decimal' button. If you want to clear the input, click the 'C' button.
